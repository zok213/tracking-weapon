    to reflect the sampled texts and can optionally pad the text list to a fixed length.

    Attributes:
        prompt_format (str): Format string for text prompts.
        neg_samples (Tuple[int, int]): Range for randomly sampling negative texts.

        padding_value (str): The text used for padding when padding is True.

    Methods:
        __call__: Processes the input labels and returns updated classes and texts.
